# REST APIs

REST APIs are a standard that use HTTP requests sent to specific URL endpoints to allow programs to interact
with a server. The most common types of request are GET, POST, and DELETE.

## The `requests` module
A 3rd party library for python, `requests` is often used to manage network requests due to its ease of use.
requests has built in functions for assembling these requests in the backend, so sending an unauthorized GET
request is as simple as `requests.get(url)`. There are many other functions in this module that can be discovered in [the documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Headers
Headers are additional data sent as part of an HTTP request. Many things are encoded in these headers to identify what kind of network traffic something is (try looking at the `headers` attribute of the response
returned from a requests call), and often they are used to transmit authentication for protected data. In python, we assemble these via a dictionary, as so:  
``` py
headers = {  
    "username": "Zach",  
    "password": "Squeer",  
}
```

Note that there are built in methods in the `requests` module for handling this assembly

## Params
Parameters (or params) are additional data needed to complete the API request, and can be manually encoded into the url used for the api request. They can be identified by a question mark preceding them.

                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              This is a parameter                 
```

In python we would, again, transmit this by packaging it into a dictionary and sending it via the `params`
keyword in the function we use for the request.

``` py
myparams = {
    "v": "dQw4w9WgXcQ"
}

response = requests.get(url, auth=(username, password), params=myparams)
```
